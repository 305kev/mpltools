============
Figure shape
============

Often, you want to adjust the shape (or aspect ratio) of a figure, but you
don't want to explicitly calculate its size. Matplotlib provides a function
called ``figaspect`` to fill this role. To adjust the aspect ratio of the
figure, ``plt.figaspect`` will change the *width* of the figure.  In contrast,
``layout.figaspect`` will change the *height* of the figure.  This behavior is
convenient if you have a fixed-width requirement (e.g., the width of columns in
a journal page or the width of a web page).

In this example, ``layout.figaspect`` creates a figure that doesn't fit comfortably onto the page, while ``plt.figaspect`` does not.
