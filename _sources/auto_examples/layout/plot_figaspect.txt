============
Figure shape
============

Often, you want to adjust the shape (or aspect ratio) of a figure, but you
don't want to explicitly calculate its size. Matplotlib provides a function
called ``figaspect`` to fill this role. To adjust the aspect ratio of the
figure, ``plt.figaspect`` will change the *width* of the figure.
``layout.figaspect`` will, instead, change the *height* of the figure.  This
behavior is convenient if you have a fixed-width requirement (e.g., the width
of columns in a journal page or the width of a web page).
