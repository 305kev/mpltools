Slope marker
============

When viewing data, it's often helpful to add a marker representing the
predicted or measured slope. ``mpltools.annotation.slope_marker`` provides
a simple way of adding a slope marker by specifying the origin of the marker
(normally, the left-most corner of the marker, but, when ``invert=True``, it's
the right-most corner) and the slope---either as a float value or a (rise, run)
tuple.
