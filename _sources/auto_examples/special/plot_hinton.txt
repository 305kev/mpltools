Hinton diagram
==============

Hinton diagrams are useful for visualizing the values of a 2D array: Positive
and negative values are represented by white and black squares, respectively,
and the size of each square represents the magnitude of each value.

``special.hinton`` is based off of the `Hinton demo`_ in the matplotlib gallery. This implementation, however, uses a ``RegularPolyCollection`` to draw
squares, which is much more efficient than drawing individual rectangles.

Obscure example use: For my Ph.D., I wrote a numerical solver using
finite-differences. For speed, the Jacobian matrices were calculated
analytically, which was incredibly-prone to bugs. To debug my code,
I calculated the numerical Jacobian (calculated using
``scipy.optimize.slsqp.approx_jacobian``) and plotted the Hinton diagram for
the difference of the numerical and analytical results. That allowed me to
narrow down where the bugs were (boundary conditions!) instead of blindly
checking every equation. You could, of course, use ``pcolor`` or ``imshow`` in
a similar situation.
