====================
`plot2rst` extension
====================

`plot2rst` is a sphinx extension that converts a normal python file into
reStructuredText. All strings in the python file are converted into regular
reStructuredText, while all python code is converted into code blocks.

This extension is named `plot2rst` because the conversion also intelligently
handles plots. In particular, you can write a block of code that creates
a plot, and then follow that up with a discussion that has the plot added
inline. To do so, you just need to add a call to the Sphinx image directive and
set the image link to a special tag::

    .. image:: PLOT2RST. current_figure

**Note** that there shouldn't be a space after the period in a real call---it's
added here to prevent `plot2rst` from replacing the tag with an image path.

All the code that runs before this call will be executed, the current figure
will be saved, and the tag will be replaced with the path to that figure.

So here's a line plot:


.. code-block:: python

	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	
	x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi)
	plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
	
	

This plot can be displayed inline with a call the ``current_figure`` tag:

.. image:: images/plot_plot2rst_1.png


And here's a second plot in a *new figure*:


.. code-block:: python

	
	plt.figure()
	plt.imshow(np.random.random(size=(20, 20)))
	
	

which gets displayed as:

.. image:: images/plot_plot2rst_2.png

You can also add to plots created in previous code blocks:


.. code-block:: python

	x = np.linspace(0, 19)
	plt.plot(x, 5 * np.sin(x) + 10, alpha=0.5, lw=5)
	plt.margins(0)
	
	

.. image:: images/plot_plot2rst_3.png

There's some subtle differences between strings and comments which I'll
demonstrate below. (Some of this only makes sense if you look at the raw python
file.)

# Comments in text blocks remain nested in the text.



.. code-block:: python

	
	def dummy():
	    """Dummy function to make sure docstrings don't get rendered as text"""
	    pass
	
	# Code comments are not strings and are left in code blocks.
	
	
Any string that's not saved to a variable is converted to text

.. code-block:: python

	
	string = """
	Triple-quoted string which tries to break parser but doesn't.
	"""
	
	

Finally, I'll call ``show`` at the end just so someone running the python code
directly will see the plots; this is not necessary for creating the docs.


.. code-block:: python

	plt.show()
